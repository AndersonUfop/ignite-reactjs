# Challenge 02 - Componentizing the application

![WatchMe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49786548/131221368-b5caf1ba-1a26-45c2-99ad-3caa78d437cf.png)

## 💻 About the challenge

This will be an application where your main objective is to refactor a page for movie listings according to genre.

The application is now fully functional but most of its code is directly in the `App.tsx` file. To solve this in the best way, it is necessary to divide the application into **at least** two main parts: sidebar and the main content that has the header and the movie listing.

- The application has only one main feature which is the movie listing;
- In the sidebar it is possible to select which category of movies should be listed;
- The first category in the list (which is "Action") must already start as marked;
- The application header only has the name of the selected category, which should change dynamically.
